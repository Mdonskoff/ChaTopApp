# Chatop App

### Context
Implement the back-end of an Angular website. This is a seasonal rental application. 

### Technology
Java 17
Spring Boot
IDE (IntelliJ)
MySql Workbench or a MySql database installed
Software (like Postman)

## How to build
- Clone this repository in a local location on your machine.
- Connect to MySql Workbench and import the database.sql file in the ChaTopApp folder.
- Execute the SQL script to create the database and tables users, rental and message.
- Open the ChaTopApp project with IntelliJ.
- Modify the DB_USERNAME and DB_PASSWORD variables in the .env file. These are the variables that allow you to connect to Mysql. 
- Check the other variables and adapt them to your environment if necessary.
- Run the application with intellij.
You can now use a software like Postman or a front-end app (Angular, React etc...) to communicate with the back-end.
